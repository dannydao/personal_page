            <p>Currently I am a junior at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. I am working towards a BS in <strong> Cybersecurity</strong> and a minor
                in <strong> Computer Science</strong>. I am Vietnamese and 25 years old currently. While not taking classes, I am working as a security 
                guard at Charles Schwab. Currently I have a few goals in mind such as improving my programming skills and securing an internship in the
                field of software development or information technology so I can get hands-on experience in the field that I would like to work in after
                accomplishing my main goal, which is graduating college.</p>

        <h2 class="section_hobbies"> My Hobbies </h2>
        <p> There are many hobbies that I enjoy doing outside of school and work. Learning and improving my programming knowledge is important, but 
            I enjoy gaming as a way to relax. I prefer competitive shooters such as <strong>Valorant</strong>, which is basically the only game I 
            play often currently. When the weather conditions are right, I enjoy going to out to go <strong>fishing</strong> and when I am out there,
            I usually target <strong>Largemouth Bass </strong>. Traveling is also something I enjoy quite a bit. Currently I have visited about 10 of the 
            states in the U.S. and outside of that, I have been to <strong>Canada</strong>, <strong>Vietnam</strong>, <strong>Thailand</strong> and 
            <strong>Cambodia</strong>.</p>
